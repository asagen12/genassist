"""Rule scoping shared by every rule-based evaluation technique.

A rule is graded over a *scope unit* rather than always over one turn:

    every_turn     — graded once per turn (one result per turn)
    conversation   — graded once per conversation, over all of its turns
    specific_turn  — graded once per targeted turn, on the turns you picked

Conversation scope is what makes "a ticket is created once per conversation"
expressible: the assertion holds when it is satisfied somewhere in the
conversation, not on every single turn.

This module owns the scope contract (the rule fields and the planner); each
technique supplies its own grading function.
